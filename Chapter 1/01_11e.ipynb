We weren't sure we could do it, but the gang at Wisdom was very supportive and encouraging. Now, two years later, Samantha is still free from any complications of diabetes, and her blood sugar regularly tests normal. Thank you, Wisdom Pet Medicine!\n",

The vet noted our address on Roxie's chart, and asked if we lived on one of the orchards in the vicinity, and if Roxie had a habit of eating grapes off the vine. Our answer was \"of course â she's a Retriever.\" That day we learned just how toxic grapes and raisins are to pets, and Roxie is no longer allowed to roam unattended in the orchard.\n",

In order to kill the harmful bacteria in his blood, we had to use a dog antibiotic in his tank every day for a week, and in the end, McAllister was good as new. I still smile upon remembering Dr. Chase pulling out an old vet school textbook to calculate the correct antibiotic dose for a fish!\n",
