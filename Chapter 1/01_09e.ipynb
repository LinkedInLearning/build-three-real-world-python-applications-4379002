Our answer was \"of course â\\x80\\x93 she\\'s a Retriever.\" That day we learned just how toxic grapes and raisins are to pets, and Roxie is no longer allowed to roam unattended in the orchard.</span>\\n            <span class=\"customer\">John B</span>\\n          </div>\\n        </blockquote>\\n\\n        <blockquote class=\"col-md-6 col-lg-3\" id=\"lorraines\">\\n          <div class=\"quote\">\\n            <span class=\"intro\">Wisdom Pet Medicine is the only clinic around that will even</span>\\n            <span class=\"more\">book pet fish for appointments.

In order to kill the harmful bacteria in his blood, we had to use a dog antibiotic in his tank every day for a week, and in the end, McAllister was good as new.
